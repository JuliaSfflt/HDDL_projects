The objective of this mini-project is to define and train a Conditional VAE
(CVAE), by following the instructions below:
• Find resources that explain what a CVAE is, it’s difference with VAEs, the
loss functions used to train it etc.
• Train a CVAE on the Fashion-MNIST dataset (available to download from
torchvision).
• Generate 5 new samples for each class of the Fashion-MNIST dataset using
the CVAE.
• Use Pytorch
• Explain and argue the different choices you make along the way, in particular:
– The choice of the architecture, the layer types, the layer sizes and the
activations.
– The choice of the different hyper-parameters: batch size, learning rate,
number of epochs, regularization weight...
– The choice of the loss function, the different terms in it, and their
individual purposes.
• Include links to articles, blog posts, videos... that helped you decide on the
above choices.
• Include the code of the different trials/experiments that helped you decide
on the above choices.
• Plot different visualizations for the results: the curves of the different terms
in the loss functions, the learnt latent space...
